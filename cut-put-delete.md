Here's what I used to do:

Ctrl+Insert : Copy to the clipboard

Shift+Insert : PASTE from the clipboard

Shift+Delete : Cut TO the clipboard

Now I have an Apple Keyboard, I do: (The apple keyboard does not have an insert key)

Ctrl+C to Copy to the clipboard

Ctrl+V to PASTE FROM the clipboard

Shift+Delete to cut TO THE clipboard.
